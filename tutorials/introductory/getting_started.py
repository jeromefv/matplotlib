#
# Introduction
# ============
#
# Matplotlib is a Python library providing tools for users to create
# visualizations with data.
#
# The library is accessible through a variety of operating systems and
# programming environments. The fundamental ideas behind Matplotlib for
# visualizations involve taking data and transforming it through functions and
# methods. This process occurs on the backend and is not user-facing. For more
# information regarding manipulating backend capabilities, see
# :ref:`backends`.
#
# There are two main ways of producing graphs with Matplotlib, explicit and
# implicit. Explicit code, using Object Oriented Programming (OOP), and
# implicit code, using ``pyplot``, are the foundation for creating and
# manipulating data into visualizations.
#
# +------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
# | Explicit, Object Oriented          | Implicit, ``pyplot``               |
# | Programming (OOP)                  |                                    |

# | configurations of graphs.          | environments.                      |
# +------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
# | Recommended to new users for       | Most useful for users coming from  |
# | learning fundamentals.             | MATLAB.                            |
# +------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
#
# Explicit programming helps users generalize code and is useful for repeated
# uses or larger projects. This is also a more robust way of controlling
# customizations for visualizations. Users looking to have control over every
# part of the graph can call methods on each item. Most users benefit using
# explicit programming for regular Matplotlib use as the user manages each
# element of building a graph.
#
# Implicit programming with ``pyplot`` is simpler. It is helpful for basic
# plots and for interactive environments, such as Jupyter Notebooks. Users
# familiar with MATLAB or would like to have Matplotlib automatically create
# and manage parts of the visualization benefit from using the ``pyplot``
# module to graph data. New users to Matplotlib may experience difficulty
# understanding how elements of a visualization work together when using the
# implicit approach.

#
#
# Requirements
# ============
#
# Matplotlib is a Python library and an installed version of *Python 3.6 or
# higher* is required. Depending on your operating system, Python may already
# be installed on your machine.
#
# Installing Maptlotlib is required in order to generate graphs with the
# library. Install Matplotlib for your own development environment manually or
# use a third-party package distribution.
#
# Third-party package distributions, such as
# `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_,
# `ActiveState <https://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads>`_,
# or `WinPython <https://winpython.github.io/>`_,
# already provide Matplotlib and its dependencies. They have the added benefit
# of including other scientific Python libraries as well. These packages work
# as is and do not require additional installations.
#
# Installation from source
# ------------------------
#
# In order to install Matplotlib from the source directory, run the
# following command line executions using Python and installer program ``pip``
# for the latest version of Matplotlib and its dependencies. This will compile
# the library from the current directory on your machine. Depending on your
# operating system, you may need additional support.
#
# ``python -m pip install matplotlib``
#
# .. seealso::
#
#     To contribute to the Matplotlib community, check
#     :ref:`developers-guide-index`
#     for details about working with the latest sources.
#
# Interactive environments
# ------------------------
#
# The Matplotlib community suggests using `IPython <https://ipython.org/>`_
# through `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/index.html>`_ as the primary
# interactive environment.

##############################################################################
#
# Plotting
# ========
#
# The common convention for preparing to plot data involves importing the
# Matplotlib library module ``pyplot`` with the abbreviation ``plt`` for
# convenience. Both explicit and implicit programming require the following
# code.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

##############################################################################
#
# The ``pyplot`` module in Matplotlib is a collection of functions. The
# module's functions create, manage, and manipulate the current Figure and the
# plotting area.
#
# Two Approaches for Creating Graphs
# ----------------------------------
#
# The two strategies, explicit and implicit, both involve using the ``pyplot``
# module. However, they differ in how users interact with the data in the
# transformation process. The `Introduction`_ and `Examples`_ sections above
# provide key differences.
#
# +------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
# | Explicit                           | Implicit                           |
# +====================================+====================================+
# | * Code has explicit references to  | * The programming is designed to   |
# |   objects. Users manage objects for|   remember preceding events or     |
# |   the specific Figure and Axes and |   interactions. This preserved     |
# |   call on methods for manipulating |   state allows Matplotlib to       |
# |   data.                            |   automatically manage a Figure and|
# | * Object Oriented Programming      |   Axes.                            |
# |   allows for robust control and is | * The module ``pyplot`` operates   |
# |   useful for generalized code.     |   similarly to MATLAB and is       |
# |                                    |   convenient for interactive       |
# |                                    |   environments.                    |
# +------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
#
# .. note::
#
#     The Matplotlib community does not recommend interchanging explicit and
#     implicit strategies. When using one as standard, all code should follow
#     the same strategy. Switching back and forth between explicit and
#     implicit programming can yield errors.
#
# For other techniques of creating plots with Matplotlib, refer to
# :ref:`user_interfaces`.
#
# Data
# ----
#
# The Matplotlib library manages data in the form of iterables and/or
# sequenced items. These can also take the form of NumPy arrays like
# `numpy.array` or `numpy.ma.masked_array`. All plotting functions take these
# data structures.
#

#
#    Other containers, such as `pandas` data objects, may not work as
#    intended.
#
# Explicit: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
# --------------------------------------------
#
# To use explicit programming for Matplotlib involves using a single instance
# of the ``pyplot`` module. This unpacks a set of an explicit Figure and Axes.
# There can be more than one Axes; however, each Axes can only be on one
# Figure.
#
# Each Axes has its own methods to graph data. In addition, each Axes
# also uses separate methods to create and manage parts of a Figure. These
# methods are different from those of the implicit programming approach.

# Explicit programming with OOP

x = months
y1 = income
y2 = chk_acct_09
y3 = svg_acct_09
# Assigning sample data to labeled variables.

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
# Explicit Figure & Axes unpacked separately with module.

ax.plot(x, y1, label='Checking Account')
ax.plot(x, y2, label='Savings Account')
ax.plot(x, y3, label='Income')
# Single explicit Axes graphs multiple data points.

ax.set_xlabel('Month')
ax.set_ylabel('USD')
ax.set_title('Personal Financial Tracking from 2009')
ax.legend()
# Explicit Axes use separate methods to manage parts of Figure.

plt.show()
# The pyplot module displays the Figure.

##############################################################################
#
# For the OOP example, the Figure and Axes are unpacked from the module using
# a single instance of ``pyplot``. This convention uses ``plt.subplots()``
# and defaults to one Figure, ``fig``, and one Axes, ``ax``. The
# `Customizations`_ section below contains additional information about
# multiple visulizations and other modifications.
#
# Using the OOP approach allows for ``fig`` and ``ax`` to use separate methods
# to manipulate the visualization. Instead of using the module ``pyplot`` for
# all instances of managing objects, the specfic Axes refers to OOP usage and
# manages the respective data.
#
# Implicit: ``pyplot``
# --------------------
#
# Implicit programming for Matplotlib centers around using the ``pyplot``
# module. The Figure and Axes are automatically generated by the module.
# The methods and functions within the module take incoming data as arguments.
# Additional parts of the Figure are also available through the module
# methods.

# Implicit programming with pyplot

y4 = chk_acct_10
y5 = svg_acct_10
# Assigning former data to labeled variable.
# Previous variables are still referenced.

plt.plot(x, y1, label='Income')
plt.plot(x, y4, label='Checking Account')
plt.plot(x, y5, label='Savings Account')
# Module plots multiple data points on implicitly generated Axes.

plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('USD')
plt.title("Personal Financial Tracking from 2010")
plt.legend()
# Module methods generate parts of Figure.

plt.show()
# The module displays the Figure.

##############################################################################
#
# In the example above, the ``pyplot`` module contains its own methods of
# actionable tasks for the data. The ``plt.plot`` plots data as a line graph
# with various keyword arguments as customizable options. The module also
# includes other methods for generating parts of the visualization. These parts
# use different methods from the OOP approach.
#
# .. note::
#
#    The names and spelling for methods may be similar for both explicit and
#    implicit approaches. Errors may occur when using the wrong corresponding
#    method. Confirm with the documentation API of `~.axes.Axes` for explicit
#    and mod:`matplotlib.pyplot` for implicit or other respective method
#    names.
#
# Customizations
# ==============
#
# There are two main parts to building a visualization with Matplotlib, the
# ``Figure`` and the ``Axes``.
#
# Components of Matplotlib Figure
# -------------------------------
#
# The image below depicts each visible element of a Matplotlib graph. The
# graphic uses Matplotlib to display and highlight each individual part of the
# visualization. The source code is available as
# :ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_showcase_anatomy.py`.
#
# .. note::
#
#     ``Figure`` and ``Axes`` identify empty regions of the diagram;
#     however, these elements are foundational in operation.
#
# .. image:: ../../_static/anatomy.png
#
# :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`
#
# The Figure is the working space for the programming. All visible
# objects on a graph are located within the Figure.
#
# :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`
#
# Axes are subplots within the Figure. They contain Figure elements and
# are responsible for plotting and configuring additional details. Each
# Figure can contain multiple Axes, but each Axes is specific to one
# Figure.
#
# Other Components
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# :class:`~matplotlib.artist.Artist`
#
# Artists are the visible elements when the Figure is rendered. They
# correspond to a specific Axes and cannot be shared or transferred.
#
# .. note::
#
#   Axes and Axis are not synonymous. Axis refers to
#   :class:`~matplotlib.axis.Axis`.
#
#
# Multiple Graphs within a Figure
# -------------------------------
#
# For multiple graphs using a single Figure, explicit and implicit approaches
# use a similar convention for mapping out multiple Axes. Matplotlib manages
# more than one Axes in a two-dimensional matrix. They are arranged by row
# amount and then by column amount. The third argument represents the specific
# Axes involved.
#
# When looking for more complex solutions to multiple graphs within a Figure,
# use the :class:`matplotlib.gridspec.GridSpec` module to organize the layout.
#
# Explicit
# ^^^^^^^^

# Explicit with OOP

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2,
                               sharey='row',
                               figsize=[8, 4],
                               constrained_layout=True)
# Figure and two Axes unpacked from arguments (1, 2) as row & column.
# Keyword arguments provide additional details of sharing Y-axis, Figure size
# and layout formatting.

fig.suptitle('Personal Financial Tracking \'09 - \'10')
# Explicit Figure object has separate method for title.

ax1.plot(x, y1, label='Income')
ax1.plot(x, y2, label='Checking')
ax1.plot(x, y3, color='green', label='Savings')
# First explicit Axes object plots data with additional keyword arguments.

ax1.set_xticks(months)
ax1.set_xticklabels(months, rotation=270)
ax1.set_title('2009', fontsize='small')
ax1.legend(loc='upper left')
# First explicit Axes object uses separate methods for ticks on the X-axis,
# title, and legend. Keyword arguments are for additional configurations.

ax2.plot(x, y1, label='Income')
ax2.plot(x, y4, label='Checking')
ax2.plot(x, y5, color='green', label='Savings')
# Explicit second Axes object plots data similarly to first explicit Axes.

ax2.set_xticks(months)
ax2.set_xticklabels(months, rotation=270)
ax2.set_title('2010', fontsize='small')
# Explicit second Axes object has separate methods as well.

plt.show()
# The pyplot module displays the Figure.

##############################################################################
#
# The OOP example above also uses two Axes to graph the data. However, the OOP
# approach must refer to an explicitly generated Axes after creating both the
# Figure and Axes.
#
# In the unpacking process, numerous Axes can also be assigned to the single
# variable. To reference a specific Axes, you can index the location of the
# respective Axes as a matrix through the single variable.
#
# .. note::
#
#   The code below demonstrates indexing multiple Axes.
#   ::
#
#       fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,2)
#
#       ax[0,0].plot([1,2,3],[1,2,3])
#       ax[0,1].plot([3,2,1],[3,2,1])
#       ax[1,0].plot([3,2,1],[3,2,1])
#       ax[1,1].plot([1,2,3],[1,2,3])
#
# Implicit
# ^^^^^^^^

# Implicit with pyplot

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
# Module implicitly manages a matrix size of (1, 2) for row & column
# to work on the first implicit Axes.

plt.plot(x, y1, label='Income')
plt.plot(x, y2, label='Checking')
plt.plot(x, y3, color='green', label='Savings')
# Module plots data on first implicit Axes.

plt.xticks(x, months, rotation=270)
plt.title('2009', fontsize='small')
# Module methods generate parts of Figure for first implicit Axes.

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
# Module implicitly manages matching matrix size to work on second implicit
# Axes.

plt.plot(x, y1, label='Income')
plt.plot(x, y4, label='Checking')
plt.plot(x, y5, color='green', label='Savings')
# Module plots data on second implicit Axes.

plt.xticks(x, months, rotation=270)
plt.title('2009', fontsize='small')
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1), loc='upper left')
# Module methods generate parts of Figure for second implicit Axes.

plt.suptitle('Personal Financial Tracking')
plt.tight_layout()
# Module methods for managing Figure elements.

plt.show()
# Module displays the Figure.

##############################################################################
#
# The ``pyplot`` example above uses two Axes to graph data. In each instance,
# Matplotlib auotmatically manages the specific Axes so that each action of
# plotting data does not interfere with the previous instance.
#
# .. note::
#
#   There are limitations for customizing the implicit approach without
#   referencing specific Axes and Artists within the Figure. For more
#   advanced configurations, the explicit approach is recommended.
#
# Generalized Function Guidelines
